# CURSOR SETTINGS CATALOGUE

## Goal
Goal of this project is: 
- **gather all cursor rules and commands** useful for development and provide a single source of truth for any future project
- **continuously modify and improve** cursor settings while working on new architectures, technologies, methodologies, stacks, libraries, frameworks, etc.
- **help to select only the appropriate** rules and commands for selected architecture, stack, technology, etc.
- **avoid garbaging and overloading LLM context** with irrelevant rules
- let user to **mix and extend cursor settings for specific project** 

## Requirements

Cursor rules and commands must:
- have **simple, clear and human friendly folder structure**, separating cursor settings by architecture, technologies, methodologies, stacks, libraries, frameworks, purposes.
- follow **best practices and standards** for cursor settings
- be **specific** to concrete stack, architecture, technology etc
- keep settings **flexible for any mix of adjacent technologies**. For example, write abstract pseudo code for adjacent technologies and specific code for technology descibed in current setting

## How To Use

1. **Select appropriate cursor settings** manually or by AI agent. Choose from catalog following [architecture-selection.mdc](rules/documentation/sdd/architecture-selection.mdc)
2. **Clone or copy** cursor settings to your project directory and **mix and extend** for your specific needs
3. **Use** cursor settings for development
