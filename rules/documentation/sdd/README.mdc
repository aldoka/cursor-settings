# Spec Driven Development (SDD) Rules

## 📋 Overview

This directory contains rules for Spec Driven Development (SDD), a methodology that emphasizes creating detailed specifications before writing implementation code. These rules are optimized for AI agent-assisted development.

## 📚 Rules in This Directory

### Core Rules

1. **[principles.mdc](principles.mdc)**
   - Universal SDD principles (all architectures)
   - API-specific principles
   - AI agent development principles
   - **When to use**: Start here to understand SDD fundamentals

2. **[api-standards.mdc](api-standards.mdc)**
   - API-specific SDD standards
   - OpenAPI specification best practices
   - Machine-readable API contracts
   - **When to use**: For projects with APIs (REST, GraphQL, etc.)

3. **[implementation.mdc](implementation.mdc)**
   - Code generation from specifications
   - Validation and testing practices
   - Maintaining spec-implementation sync
   - **When to use**: When implementing code from specifications


### Additional Resources

4. **[commands-suggestions.md](commands-suggestions.md)**
   - Suggested cursor commands for SDD
   - Command categories and priorities
   - **When to use**: When creating SDD-related commands

## 📖 Reading Order

## 📝 Key Concepts

### Universal Principles
- Specification First
- Human Reviewability
- Meaningful Decomposition
- Continuous Validation
- Structured Specifications
- Maintain as Source of Truth
- Effective AI Agent Usage

### API-Specific Principles
- Machine-Readable Contracts
- Actionable Error Messages
- Consistency and Predictability
- Explicit Semantic Context
- Idempotency and State Management
- Security by Design
- Versioning Strategy

### AI Agent Principles
- Specification Clarity for AI
- Iterative Refinement
- Validation and Testing
- Tool Integration

## 🛠 Tools Mentioned

- **OpenAPI Generator**: Code generation
- **Spectral**: Specification validation
- **Dredd**: Contract testing
- **Prism**: Mock server generation
- **Swagger UI / ReDoc**: Documentation
- **Stoplight**: API design platform

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Not all projects need SDD**: Check [architecture-selection.mdc](architecture-selection.mdc) first
- **Specification is source of truth**: Always update spec before code
- **Generate, don't write**: Use code generation tools
- **Validate continuously**: Automate validation
- **AI agent optimized**: Rules designed for AI-assisted development

**Remember**: SDD is a methodology, not a requirement. Use it when it adds value to your project. For API projects and AI agent development, SDD is highly recommended.
